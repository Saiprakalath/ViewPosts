### Summary

This test is a part of our hiring process at Global Tote Lankan for frontend position. It should take you between 4 and 6 hours depending on your experience.
The primary goal of this exercise is to assess how you reason about your ability to write clean, well tested and reusable code.
To give you an idea, here is what you should need to implement app looks like:

![Alt text](app.png?raw=true "Title")


### Application requirements are given below, and the app must have the following functionalities:
 
 1. The list of posts should be display in the application.
 2. Show pagination at the bottom of the table. (don’t use any react libraries for pagination).
 3. Add a filter option to filter out the post limit. (make the dropdown list).
 4. Display the total post count in the top left corner of the table.
 5. Display the page number in the top right corner of the application.
 6. Add spinner when loading the posts.
 7. Write the unit test cases for the below scenarios
     - Each post must be have id, title, post
     - When selecting the limit, it should be equal to the expected number of posts.
     - The total posts count should be equal to the api post count


#### Note - Use the below api call for implementing the application.

### Bonus
If you can implement this application using react typescript is a big plus point

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
